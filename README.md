# ‚ö†Ô∏è ReSource Risk Management

The following decentralized infrastructure is responsible for providing **Credit Networks** with the means to analyze, predict, and mitigate credit risk within a mutual credit context.

Risk can be thought of in two categories: **network wide risk** and **member specific risk.**

####Network Risk
Network risk is addressed via a **Risk Oracle** infrastructure that is responsible for monitoring and analyzing network risks in order to calculate a given network's _risk variables_. These variables include the price of risk (the network's "base fee") as well as the required reserve size (the network's "RTD") needed to safely maintain stability.

The **Risk Oracle** infrastructure is federated by a network registry that determines if a network's risk is being indexed and analyzed. The risk analysis provided by the **_RiskOracle.sol_** is then used by the **_RiskManager.sol_** contract to translate analyzed risk into the network _risk variables_.

####Member Risk
Member risk is addressed through effective underwriting and proper credit term structuring and assignment. The **_CreditIssuer.sol_** contract is responsible for defining and issuing the credit terms (ex. credit limit, fee rate) associated with a given network to be tracked over a configured _credit period_.

## Protocol Overview

The following diagram depicts how **Stable Credit** networks interact with the **ReSource Risk Management** protocol to stabilize their credit currencies.

## Contracts:

- **`RiskManager.sol`**: Responsible for referencing risk analysis provided by the `RiskOracle` contract to update network risk variables (ex. BaseFee, target RTD).
- **`ReservePool.sol`**: Responsible for storing and transferring network reference tokens in order to back the credit currency.
- **`RiskOracle.sol`**: Responsible for exposing calculated network risk data.
- **`CreditIssuer.sol`**: Responsible for underwriting network participants to issue credit terms (note: base implementation intended to be extended)
- **`ReSourceCreditIssuer.sol`** Example extended **CreditIssuer** contract with custom credit terms including minimum ITD (Income to Debt ratio) and credit re-balancing.
