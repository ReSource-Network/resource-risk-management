# ‚ö†Ô∏è ReSource Risk Management

The following decentralized infrustrucutre is responsible for providing **ReSource Stable Credit** networks with the means to analyze, predict, and mitigate credit risk within a mutual credit context.

To accomplish this, this protocol interfaces with the **ReSource Stable Credit** protocol and **Masa Finance** protocol.

- **`RiskOracle.sol`**: Responsible for exposing .
- **`CreditIssuer.sol`**: Responsible for underwriting network participants to issue credit terms (note: base implementation intended to be extended)
